# WordReplacementProgram
 We use the python replace method so as to accomplish this.  We start by asking the user to input his sentence Then we ask him which word he wants to replace and also the word which will replace it, once these 2  informations are known, we use the replace method  on the sentence and then store the result in a  variable and then print the outcome
